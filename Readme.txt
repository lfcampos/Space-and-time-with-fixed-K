This is an extension of the model described in: 

> ``Disentangling Overlapping Astronomical Sources using Spatial and Spectral Information" Jones, Kashyap, van Dyk (ApJ 2015). 

The allgorithm uses spatial, temporal and spectral information of a fixed number of sources to find the joint posterior distribution their spatial, temporal and spectral parameters.
