**This is an extension of the model described in**: 
``Disentangling Overlapping Astronomical Sources using Spatial and Spectral Information" Jones, Kashyap, van Dyk (ApJ 2015). 

# Description

The algorithm uses spatial, temporal and spectral information of a fixed number of sources to find the joint posterior distribution their spatial, temporal and spectral parameters.
